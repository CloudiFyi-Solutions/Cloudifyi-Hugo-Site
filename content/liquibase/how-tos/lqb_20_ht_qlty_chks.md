## Reading Quality Checks Output

The output of Liquibase quality checks provides a ton of information but is very descriptive.
Let's break the output into sections to explain further:

### Metadata
This section shows metadata about the quality checks run:
- the root changelog Liquibase used to access your changelogs.
- confirmation a valid license key was located (only licensed versions of Liquibase can run quality checks).
- if quality checks were run against data in the database itself (we currently don't have this configured).
- the database connection string.

### Detailed Checks
This section shows detailed information about the quality checks run against each changeset in the changelog(s):
- Check Name: name of quality check that was run
- Changeset ID: changeset ID of changeset quality check was run against.
- Changeset Filepath: file path where the changeset is located.
- Check Severity: the severity level and return code (exit code) that was returned when the check completed.
- Message: the warning associated with the quality check. This provides helpful information about the quality check.

This is repeated for all changesets in the changelog. *Add tooltip here*
