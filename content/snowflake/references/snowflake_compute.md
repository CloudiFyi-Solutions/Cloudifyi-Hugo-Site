### Snowflake Compute Guidelines

For details on Snowflake's virtual warehouse sizes, consult the following link: https://www.snowflake.com/pricing-page-registration-page/?utm_cta=website-pricing-learn-more-about-snowflake-cta-pricing-guide

Here's a general guide for recommending computational resources based on task categories:

| Task Description | Snowflake Virtural Warehouse Recommendation|
|---------------|---------------|
|Software Development| Small or Medium - For development purposes, starting with a smaller size and adjusting based on performance needs can be cost-effective.|
|Machine Learning and Data Analysis|Medium or Large - Depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of ML models and analysis.| 
|Server Workloads (e.g., databases, web servers)|X-Small or Small - For lightweight server-related tasks, but generally, traditional server workloads don't apply to Snowflake.|
|High-Performance Computing (HPC)|Large or X-Large - For compute-intensive tasks, but remember, Snowflake is primarily designed for data analytics rather than traditional HPC tasks.|
